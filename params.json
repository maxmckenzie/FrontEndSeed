{"name":"Frontendseed","tagline":"FrontEndSeed is a template project for developing static websites fast... really fast.","body":"# FrontEndSeed\r\nSeed Project for prototypes and production front end static-ish websites.\r\nbased on Express and Node. Its designed to be the jump off point when starting a new project.\r\n\r\n# Prerequisites\r\nyou need to have the below installed for this project.\r\n\r\n> Installing Ruby can be quite fidderly if your not familiar with it. We use it here to run UI tests so dont worry about it for the moment, you can set it up later. Mac comes with ruby installed but alas its the wrong version for our needs.\r\n\r\n- Node https://nodejs.org/\r\n- Bower http://bower.io/\r\n- Ruby http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/\r\n- Ruby Gems http://rubygems.org/\r\n- Chromedriver https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started\r\n- Bundler: `sudo gem install bundler rake`\r\n\r\n# How To Use\r\nTo start using this simply clone the repo like so\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/maxmckenzie/FrontEndSeed.git NewProject`\r\n\r\nRelace NewProject with your project name. If you didnt know this, passing this argument after the git clone url will create a directory with the name NewProject and checkout the repo into that folder.\r\n\r\nThen run `git remote remove origin` this will remove the original URL form your local repo. you can then add your repo URL. For more info on this take a look here https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/\r\n\r\n> If you arer also using Github for your project then you can simply hit the fork button on this page https://github.com/maxmckenzie/FrontEndSeed\r\n\r\n# Install and Start\r\nrun the following commands.\r\n\r\n`bower install`\r\n\r\n`bundle install`\r\n\r\n`npm install`\r\n\r\nthen run \r\n\r\n`npm start`\r\n\r\nYou will also need to run `grunt watch` when editing the Less styles. grnu twill then build the CSS output for you.\r\n\r\n# Heroku Support\r\n> Heroku is the nuts. If you've not heard of it check it out. like now.... why are you still reading this?\r\n\r\nSo to deploy to Heroku. We have to do a couple of things. Firstly go get the toolbelt from there site https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up\r\n\r\nThen run `heroku login` and enter your heroku account details.\r\n\r\nNow its time to create the app. run `heroku create myApp` or whatever you want in place of 'myApp'. Now before you push, you miust run a buildpack command to tell heroku to run a node instance, the reason for this is that our feature UI tests are in ruby. this is probelematic as heroku picks this up and sets ruby as the framework rather than node.\r\n\r\nSo you'll need to run `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs`\r\n\r\nI usually open a new shell (terminal window) at this point and run `heroku logs --tail` in the app directory. Cause we all love commands flying past right... oh yeha and thats where the error messages appear.\r\n\r\nOnce you're through the above run `git push heroku master` and watch that sweet sweet auto deploy unfold.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- NPM\r\n- Grunt\r\n- Bower\r\n- Less CSS\r\n- Bower\r\n- Rspec UI Tests\r\n\r\n## HTML Structure\r\n- og and twitter cards\r\n- Google Structured Data\r\n- IE Exceptions <html class=\"ie ie8\" lang=\"en\">\r\n- support warning for browser version and no js.
